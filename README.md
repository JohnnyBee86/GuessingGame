# GuessingGame
An Android high or low guessing game
- The game will ask players to guess if the number it's 'thinking' of is higher or lower than a 'given' number
- Both numbers will be randomly generated for each guess between 1 and 10 (inclusive)
- The 'given' number is re-rolled if it is the same as the 'thinking'
- After 5 correct guesses the game will end

## Android features used include:
- Fragments
- Event Handling (on click listeners)
- Navigation Achitecture
- Safe Args
- Toasts
